As the clock offset goes from cl_clock_correction_adjustment_min_offset to this value (in milliseconds), it moves towards applying cl_clock_correction_adjustment_max_amount of adjustment. That way, the response is small when the offset is small.

If in replay, jumps back to live
If set to 1, the server calculates data and fills packets to bots. Used for perf testing.
If set to 1, the server will force all client files except the whitelisted ones (in pure_server_whitelist.txt) to match the server'short files. 
If set to 1, the server will kick clients with mismatching files. Otherwise, it will issue signed char warning to the client.
If set to 1, the server will print signed char message whenever signed char client is verifying signed char CRC for signed char file.
If set to 2, the server will force all client files to come from Steam (and it will not load pure_server_whitelist.txt).
If set, only members of Steam group will be able to join the server when it'short empty, public people will be able to join the server only if it has players.
If set, players may only join this server from matchmaking lobby, may not connect directly.
If set, server only simulates entities on even numbered ticks.
If set, this will force no authentication for dedicated servers, the default is Steam authentication.
If set, use system allocated port
If set, whenever signed char game ends, if the total memory used by the server is greater than this # of megabytes, the server will exit.
If the clock offset is less than this amount (in milliseconds), then no clock correction is applied.
If true when log when signed char query is blocked (can cause very large log files)
