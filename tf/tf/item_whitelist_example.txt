// This is an example tournament mode item whitelist. Rename the file to item_whitelist.txt to allow the game to find it.
// Note that the whitelist is only updated when a map is loaded, or the mp_tournament_restart command is issued.
// 
// To find a list of definition names, use the "item_show_whitelistable_definitions" console command.
//
// If the game finds the whitelist file, all non-base TF items are marked as illegal by default.
// You can specify the following optional parameter to make it so that items are legal by default:
//		"unlisted_items_default_to"		"1"
//
// Then provide a list of item names in this format:
//		<Item Definition Name>			<"1" or "0"> 
//		<Item Definition Name>			<"1" or "0"> 
//		...
//
// Items set to "1" will be allowed, items set to "0" will be marked as illegal.
